# Info
Every thing that still needs to be done will go here.
## To Do:
* Add a way for the player to select whether or not they want to play with crosses or circles.
* Add a menu.
* Implement another computer to play against.
* Implement sound support (for when the player is moving on the grid and placing an object.)
That's all for now.
