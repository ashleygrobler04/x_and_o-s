This is the result of me trying to make a tic-tac-toe audio game in python.
## What can you do in the game thus far?
For now, you can move around the empty grid with your arrow keys and place crosses every where.
Currently the game only supports speech with NVDA. More screen readers will be added when the main part of the game is complete.
I hope you enjoy.
